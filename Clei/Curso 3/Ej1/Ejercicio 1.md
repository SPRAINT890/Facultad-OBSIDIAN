## Objetivo
The goal of our study was “analyzing the effectiveness of UML class diagrams and ER diagrams for the purpose of understanding which provides better support with respect to the comprehension and modification of data models from the point of view of researchers, in a contextrepresented by B.Sc. and M.Sc. students’’.

## Variable Independiente

A: ER
B: UML

"We employed a single factor within-subjects design, where the independent variable (main factor) is represented by the design notation used to represent a data model. This variable is denoted as “Method”, that can assume two values, ER diagram (ER) or UML class diagram (CD)."

For the experiments Com1, Com2, and Com3, the dependent variable is “Comprehension Level”, which denotes the comprehension level achieved by the subjects using the two methods (i.e., ER and CD). Turning to the experiment Mod, the dependent variable is “Modification Level”, related to the ability of the subjects to comprehend which modification should be applied to a data model to implement a change request.

## Variable Dependiente
